# retro-arcade\n\nMinimal static HTML/CSS/JS project that runs locally without build tools. Features a retro landing page and a lightweight Vampire Survivors-like canvas game.\n\nHow to run\n- Option A: Open index.html directly in your browser (double-click the file).\n- Option B: Serve with a simple local HTTP server and open http://localhost:8000:\n  - Python 3: python3 -m http.server\n  - Node (if installed): npx http-server .\n\nFiles\n- index.html: Landing page with full-viewport layout, retro font, centered Play overlay that starts the game.\n- styles.css: Retro aesthetic (dark gradient, subtle CRT scanlines, neon button, responsive canvas).\n- game.js: Pure vanilla JS game loop (no dependencies), DPR-aware canvas, input, enemies, projectiles, collisions, HUD, and game states.\n- specs/overview.md: Project overview.\n- specs/tasks.md: MVP tasks checklist.\n- specs/task-requirements.md: Functional and non-functional requirements.\n- specs/task-gameplay.md: Gameplay loop and AI notes.\n\nGameplay overview\n- Press Play to hide the overlay and start immediately.\n- You control a circular player, enemies spawn from screen edges and seek you.\n- Every 500ms an auto-attack fires toward the nearest enemy (mild homing); projectiles expire on hit or after a short lifetime.\n- Score increases on enemy kills. HUD shows score, HP, and elapsed time.\n- When HP reaches 0, a Game Over overlay appears with a Restart button.\n\nControls\n- Move: WASD or Arrow Keys\n- There is no manual fire; attacks are automatic.\n\nTech and browser support\n- No frameworks or build tools required; works in evergreen browsers.\n- Uses requestAnimationFrame with a clamped delta for stability.\n- Canvas is scaled for devicePixelRatio and resizes with the window.\n\nPerformance tips\n- Close other heavy tabs for best performance.\n- If your device has a very high DPR, zooming out (or reducing system scaling) can improve frame rate.\n\nCustomization\n- Tweak speeds, spawn rates, colors, and sizes in game.js constants to adjust difficulty and feel.\n
